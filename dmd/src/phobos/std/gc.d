 (i.e. it never happens when in code that does not allocate memory). In some
 circumstances, for example when a particular task is finished, it is convenient
 to explicitly run the collector and free up all memory used by that task. It
 can also be helpful to run a collection before starting a new task that would
 be annoying if it ran a collection in the middle of that task. Explicitly
 running a collection can also be done in a separate very low priority thread,
 so that if the program is idly waiting for input, memory can be cleaned up.
